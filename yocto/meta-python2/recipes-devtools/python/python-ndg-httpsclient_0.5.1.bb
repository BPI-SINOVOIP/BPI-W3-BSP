SUMMARY = "Provides enhanced HTTPS support for httplib and urllib2 using PyOpenSSL"
DESCRIPTION = "A HTTPS client implementation for \
\
        httplib (Python 2), http.client (Python 3) and \
        urllib2 (Python 2) and urllib (Python 3) \
\
â€¦ based on PyOpenSSL. PyOpenSSL provides a more fully featured SSL \
implementation over the default provided with Python and importantly enables \
full verification of the SSL peer using pyasn1."
