SUMMARY = "An abstract syntax tree for Python with inference support."
DESCRIPTION = "The aim of this module is to provide a common base \
representation of python source code. It is currently the library powering \
pylintâ€™s capabilities.\
\
It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast module. It \
rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively walking \
down the AST and building an extended ast. The new node classes have \
additional methods and attributes for different usages. They include some \
support for static inference and local name scopes. Furthermore, astroid can \
also build partial trees by inspecting living objects."
