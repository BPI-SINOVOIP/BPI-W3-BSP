meta-python2
============

Preamble
--------

Python 2 is going EOL (end of life) in January 2020 [1]. This means that all support for the
language will be on the shoulders of the community and the upstream python developers will
no longer be supporting it. This has been in the works for several years and it should come
as no surprise to ANYONE that the support is ending.

In light of the above, oe-core, meta-oe, meta-python and other layers are actively dropping
python2 recipes. This also means that the core developers for YP/OE will no longer have any
motivation to maintain python2 or python2 recipes. This includes the creator of this layer.

If your organization has legacy python2 code or depends upon upstream python2-only code, the
time has come for you to move on. Porting from python2 to python3 is well documented [2].

Continuing to depend upon python2-only code will increasingly open you up to security issues,
vulnerabilities and breakage.

Introduction
------------

This layer is intended to be the home of legacy python2 modules for OpenEmbedded.

Dependencies
------------

The meta-python2 layer depends on:

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta
	branch: master
	revision: HEAD

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
	layers: meta-oe
	branch: master
	revision: HEAD

Please follow the recommended setup procedures of your OE distribution.

Building and Continuous Integration
-----------------------------------

We have provided 'kas' [3,4] YAML files to make it easier to build the basic images supplied by
this layer. In order to make running 'kas' in a virtual environmnt easier, we have also provided
a 'Pipfile' to enable using 'pipenv' [5].

For instance, your CI workflow could include:

$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ kas build path/to/meta-python/kas-meta-python2-image.yml

Continous Integration via GitLab is also enabled by providing a .gitlab-ci.yml file.

Contributing
------------

Recipes in this layer use Debian naming, which means if it is a python library it should be prefixed
with 'python-'. The only exception to this is when the recipe is providing an executable application
that is installed in /usr/bin for example. Exceptions to Debian naming are very rare.

It is expected that recipes will provide SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, HOMEPAGE, BUGTRACKER and SECTION
variables, unless the values are unknown. It is strongly recommended to use the pypi.bbclass unless
your python module is not available on pypi.org.

It is expected that ANY upgrades to a recipe will have undergone run-time testing before submitting
the upgrade. Many other developers depend upon the quality of this layer and will be quite upset with
you when you break their builds.

It is expected that any patch adding a new recipe will also add the recipe to packagegroup-meta-python2.
This packagegroup is critical to the function of the CI system behind maintenance of this layer.

Commit messages must include a "Signed-off-by:" line, including a valid email address and a legal name
(not a nickname). The "Signed-off-by:" line means that you are either the author or have the legal right
to submit the work. Please refer to the "Submitting a patch to OpenEmbedded" [6] and "Commit Patch
Message Guidelines" [7] for guidance.

The meta-openembedded mailinglist
(openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org) is used for questions,
comments and patch review. It is subscriber only, so please register
before posting.

Send pull requests to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org with
'[meta-python2]' in the subject.

When sending single patches, please use something like: 
'git send-email -M -1 --to=openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org --subject-prefix=meta-python2][PATCH'

When a patch only applies to a stable branch, please include the branch name in the subject line,
something like '[meta-python2][zeus]'...

Maintenance
-------------------------

Layer Maintainers:
        Tim "moto-timo" Orling <TicoTimo@gmail.com>

NOTE: Support by the above maintainer will end when Yocto Project 3.1 is released in
approximately April 2020. Creation and maintainence of this layer is entirely a volunteer
effort and the author has ZERO REASON to continue using or supporting python2.
